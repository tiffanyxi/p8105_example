**This process (commit &gt; pull &gt; push) can help keep you out of trouble, although other approaches are possible.**

Section 1
=========

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from a *normal distribution*:

samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

    ## [1] 100

Section 2
=========

I can take the mean of the sample, too! The mean is -0.1539661.
